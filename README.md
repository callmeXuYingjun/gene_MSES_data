We use tick.hawkes module to generate multi-source event sequences. 

This module proposes a comprehensive set of tools for the inference and the simulation of Hawkes processes, with both parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques and flexible tools for simulation. 

Therefore, the tick library needs to be installed before running the code.
